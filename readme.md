### Watauga County, North Carolina
#### By: Dezirae Britton

###### This map is supposed to represent distribution sites in Watauga County and what items they have. Either they distribute water or food or are a recource hub for Fema. The census data represents the blocking for the county and in the future will include population density to show the demand of each distribution site. 

###### The map uses leaflet for its plugins and the U.S. Cencus Bureau information for block grouping. For the map to be fully functional the block grouping needs to associated with a population layer. Currently imformation regarding population only provides age, gender, income etc but not the individual population of blocks. 

###### Mapping spontaneous relief sites aid in telling the story about community and resiliencing of Appalachia in the face of the climate crisis. In another event it would be helpful to have already established sites to accelerate distribution of goods in the first days following a disaster.
